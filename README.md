# Personal-Portfolio-V2
A newly improved personal portfolio website built by myself! In accounts to the journey and learning of Web Development, this is what I created.

Not only will you find a better designed and improved website compared to my first portfolio! I will be showcasing a little bit more about who I am and my own likes through the website. For instance, the theme and genre I crafted this website is categorized as a Fantasy & Game-like theme.
